# Combat Design
> Designing and creating gameplay loops for various character archetypes
Characters/classes are built to each have their own unique niche and archetype. They're created with the intention
to leverage the fluidity of the combat system in place. Enemy encounters are designed to give meaningful interactions
that cause the player to make decisions that wil impact the flow of combat. Not all attacks and mechanics should be
punishments. Certain difficult mechanics reward players with opportunities to do big damage to the boss or provide them
with a beneficial buff.

## Heavy
> Slow and heavy swinging
Barbarian-type classes are a common trope that can be executed in different manners.
Attacks are weighty and mostly single hits as opposed to multi-hit.
They were also given a skill to damage themselves and negate any healing effects on themselves in exchange for an attack buff.
The Barbarian can also abort that effect by using a skill that makes them lose damage.

## Fast
> Combo intensive with extra fast hits
The Windwalker is fast paced combo class that leverages their immense mobility and flexibility to weave in attacks at even the
most risky situations. As they press their attack, they build momentum, increasing their damage and rewarding aggressive gameplay. This effect
falls off if the player spends too much time not attacking anything. 


## Tactical
> Positioning is everything
The Sniper is a marksman. Their heavy shots send them backward with recoil. Players must are strongly incentivized to use their
tumble and blink shots to reposition and land their strongest skill that only hits in a set distance away from them.
When they use some of their key skills enough times, they'll be able to access their strongest skill that fires powerful wind arrows.

## Magical
> Beams of energy
The Lunar Knight is a magical swordsman. They channel energy from celestial bodies into their sword to release as waves.
Using skills collect energy into their sword which they can expend using a powerful skill that puts them in an *Ascension* state.
There, their skills gain bonus hits and they can rain down a fierce combo of sword waves from the air.

# Visual Effects
> Lightning fast expression
Each class has their own unique identity and visuals. The skill effects give each class a texture that enhances gameplay.
Sword slashes create sparks, flashes of light emerge from beams of energy, dust erupts from the ground from a powerful bolt of lightning.

# Player Progression Design
> The roadmap
When possible, players are given multiple options for completing their objective. For those who are more interesting in challenging themselves,
there should be routes that are more difficult, but reward the player with items and loot that are worth the time and effort they invested.
Giving alternatives to party play are important. Although the highest level of play should involve party play, solo play should be
a viable alternative up to the highest level.

# Video Editing
> Flashy
Although more of a hobby, I thoroughly enjoy making trailer videos and just editing in general. I try often try to make use of 
music and sound effects to emphasize and highlight the most important parts of the video. This often means syncing up each clip
and adding effects to match with the music.

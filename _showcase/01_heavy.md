Barbarian-type classes are a common trope that can be executed in different manners.

Attacks are weighty and mostly single hits as opposed to multi-hit.
They were also given a skill to damage themselves and negate any healing effects on themselves in exchange for an attack buff.
The Barbarian can also abort that effect by using a skill that makes them lose damage.

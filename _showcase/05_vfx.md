This is Rai, a lightning assassin. They have incredible amounts of mobility in their kit which
allows them to build up "charge" stacks. When they have enough charge, they can release it in
a powerful explosion around them.

While I did not design the gameplay mechanics of the class, I had the pleasure of working on the
sound and visual design. During the process, I was given short prompts for each skill such as:

"Charge up energy, then slam the floor, creating an arcing current that races across the floor."

Using the prompt, I brainstormed and drew sketches on paper to get an idea of the visual effect.
From there, I created prototypes with leading core visuals that are the focal points of the attack
and showcased it to the character designer. When it was approved, I moved on to add additional
details. It was imperative to give each skill the right "feel". Since players would be casting
them time and time again in gameplay, they have to feel impactful.

Sound design was something I struggled with originally. After working on a few projects, I gained
some more experience. Funnily enough, it starts with an idea and trying to mimic the sound with my mouth.
Combining samples together and adjusting the volume and range to achieve the right sound is 
incredibly satisfying.

When possible, players are given multiple options for completing their objective. For those who are more interesting in challenging themselves,
there should be routes that are more difficult. The challenges reward the player with items and loot that are worth the time and effort they invested.

Giving alternatives to party play are important. Although the highest level of play should involve party play, players should be able to solo
as a viable alternative up to a point.

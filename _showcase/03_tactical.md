The Sniper is a marksman. Their heavy shots send them backward with recoil. Players must are strongly incentivized to use their
tumble and blink shots to reposition and land their strongest skill that only hits in a set distance away from them.

When they use some of their key skills enough times, they'll be able to access their strongest skill that fires powerful wind arrows.

The Sniper is a markswoman. I warped the common archer archetype by creating a gameplay
loop that involves constant repositioning to make combat more interactive instead of
idly sitting in the back of the arena firing off arrows without a care.

Attacks push the player character forward or backward. At the same time, one of their most
powerful attacks fires a rain of arrows that only strikes at a set distance away from the player.

This creates a minigame that players have to balance, incentivizing them to master the
movement and positioning of each skill while keeping an eye on the enemy's own movement
in order to land powerful volleys of arrows.

Their skills create wind energy which after enough casts, unlocks their strongest skill that puts
them in a siege stance. While in the stance the Sniper can fire off powerful piercing arrows that
finishing with a powerufl final arrow that explodes into a tornado of wind energy.

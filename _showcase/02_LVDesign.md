Level design in MMORPG instances from dungeons to raids. I had to design
some of these levels from the ground up or retheme and redecorate them for
a completely new feel. I had ot be aware of the level design's influence
on the mechanics of the instance and encounter design. When designing the
levels, I try to create a unique feeling that isn't found anywhere else
in the game or put a twist on an existing idea. Creating a narrative through
level design and decorating the levels with assets to turn it into a real
and breathing world is a real pleasure.

Fights that interact with the players and cause them to make second-to-second combat decisions.
Enemy mechanics creating a bump or pause in the action to force players to complete a task or action
that does not directly involve attacking the boss. Interweaving gameplay mechanics to create
unique experiences that promote player skill-expression. Players are also put in situations to 
make a decision as a party on how to proceed with the fight's pacing.

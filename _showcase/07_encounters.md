Fights that interact with the players and cause them to make second-to-second combat decisions.
Boss mechanics should always keep players on their feet, ready to change course at any time.
While individual play is important, mechanics that involve party play and cooperation are necessary
to make a group of players feel like a team rather than a band loosely tied together mercenaries.

While not all games have the trinity of roles that are commonly found in MMORPGs, each player should
have a role to play for the success of the team.

Factors such as checkpoints have a large influence on how difficult each encounter can be.
Failing one mechanic and being sent back to the beginning can be excrutiating and frustrating for
players. However, checkpoints serve a purpose of allowing the encounter designers to make each fight
more intimidating or complex without the risk of having players "run through the gauntlet" of encounters
just to fail to the same mechanic. While checkpoints are convenient, there needs to be a balance to
preserve the "weight" or "stakes" of each encounter.

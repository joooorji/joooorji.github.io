The Windwalker is a fast-paced combo class that utilizes acrobatics to deal damage.

Highlighting that trope, I designed the Windwalker to incentivize players to make the most
out of their evasive options by dodging and attacking mid-air.

Windwalkers use their immense mobility and flexibility to weave in attacks even in the
most risky situations. As they press the attack, they build momentum stacks, increasing their damage massively.
However, when their combo drops, they lose attack power and have to build momentum stacks again.

To play as the Windwalker effectively, players must play as aggressive as possible to maintain
their momentum stacks and consistently dodge enemy attacks to avoid dropping their combo.

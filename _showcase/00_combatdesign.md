title: Combat Design
desc: Designing and creating gameplay loops for various character archetypes
---

Characters/classes are built to each have their own unique niche and archetype. Each class is created and designed 
to leverage the fluidity of the combat system. When designing a new class, it is incredibly important to set
your goals and stick to it. Introducing a new class that is more or less like an existing one is redundant and
bloat. Each addition should create a new gameplay loop, unique mechanic, or thematic that players can attach
thsemselves to.

When a class is going through a redesign, I make sure to identify and maintain its core identity. 
One of the mistakes I made early on that I learned from was preserve the identity of a class. Redesigns are difficult
to nail since there are always a group of players that are loyal and passionate about the class that they "main." 
While gathering feedback from those players are important, it is imperative for designers to stick to their principles
and not blindly listen and implement community feedback.

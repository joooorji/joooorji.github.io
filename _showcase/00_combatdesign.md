title: Combat Design
desc: Designing and creating gameplay loops for various character archetypes
---

Characters/classes are built to each have their own unique niche and archetype. They're created with the intention
to leverage the fluidity of the combat system in place. Enemy encounters are designed to give meaningful interactions
that cause the player to make decisions that wil impact the flow of combat. Not all attacks and mechanics should be
punishments. Certain difficult mechanics reward players with opportunities to do big damage to the boss or provide them
with a beneficial buff.

title: Combat Design
desc: Designing and creating gameplay loops for various character archetypes
---

Characters/classes are built to each have their own unique niche and archetype. Each archetype is created and designed 
to leverage the fluidity of the combat system. Enemy encounters are designed to give meaningful interactions
that cause the player to make decisions that will impact the flow of combat. Not all attacks and mechanics should be
punishments. Certain difficult mechanics should reward players with opportunities to do big damage to the boss or provide players
with a beneficial buff.

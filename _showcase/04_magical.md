The Lunar Knight is a magical swordsman. They channel energy from celestial bodies into their blade to release as sword waves.

They can collect energy into their sword by casting skills which can be expended using a powerful skill that puts them in an
*Ascended* state. While *Ascended*, their skills gain bonus effects and their key skill is enhanced to rain down a fierce combo
of sword waves from the air.

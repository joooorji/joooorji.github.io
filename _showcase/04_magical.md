The Lunar Knight is a magical swordsman, channeling energy from celestial bodies into their blade to release as sword waves.

My work with the Lunar Knight was more of a visual effect revamp of their skills with minor changes to their gameplay.
Originally the skill attacks had effects that were based on tornadoes and wind energy. When I revisited this class,
I redesigned their skills to use "space-like" elements that were more in theme with the class identity.
The tornadoes were turned into sword cleaves and energy waves that collapsed in on themselves.
Beams of light that shoot the ground and explode into a constellation of stars that rain down crescents of sword waves.

On the gameplay side, I put an emphasis on aiming and positioning. As the sword waves and cleaves
pierce through enemies, players must position themselves well to maximize the hit windows of their attacks.

Barbarian-type classes are a common trope that can be executed in different manners.

In this game, I prioritized giving players a "blood rush" feeling.
Their attacks are weighty and slow, which lock them into place or slightly
nudges them forward with each swing. I gave the class the "weighty, slow, but heavy" feeling 
using visual and sound effects that emphasizes the strength of each swing of the axe.

From the gameplay standpoint, Barbarians can also enter a "frenzy" which significantly increases
their damage at the cost of lowering their max health pool and heavily reducing incoming healing.

The lack of evasive options, self-damaging mechanics, combined with massive damagepotential creates
a risk-reward gameplay loop that players must play around to optimize their combat effectiveness.

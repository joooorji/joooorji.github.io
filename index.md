I fell in love with technology at a young age. After my friend introduced me to PC games, I decided that I was going
to build my own computer. In middle school, I was finally able to achieve that goal. Since then, I have only delved
deeper into computer technology. I studied Computer Information Systems at the University of Houston, graduating in December 2022.


I first started my journey in game design with a little known game known as Dragon Nest. I first played Dragon Nest in 2011.
I was enchanted by the game, playing it almost every day for several years. As it grew into the later years of its lifespan,
I as well as many other players realized how the quality of the game has decayed. From then, I had vivid imaginations of how
I would fix the game if I was a developer.

During my sophomore year of college, I joined a small team of developers for a third-party server for the game. There, I was
finally able to realize my dream of being a game designer and developer. Using and mastering internal tools, I was able to
design and create systems and gameplay loops for players to experience.

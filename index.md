My name is George Giang and I'm an aspiring game designer and developer. I was exposed to games at a young age by my cousins and I haven't looked back since. As I got older, I gained a deeper appreciation for the art of video games and technology as a whole. I loved learning about the deeper workings of each game. I recently graduated from the University of Houston with a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems.

I first started my journey in game design and developer with a little known game known as Dragon Nest. I first played Dragon Nest in 2011 and was enchanted by the game, playing it almost every day for several years. As the game grew into the later years of its lifespan, I started to realize how far the game's quality had dropped. From then, I had vivid imaginations and had hours of conversations with my friends on how I would fix the game if I were given the opportunity to.

In 2019, I got the opportunity to join a small team of developers for a third-party server for Dragon Nest. I was
finally able to realize my dream of becoming a game designer and developer. Using and mastering internal tools, I was able to design and create gameplay loops and systems for players to experience and enjoy. Creating a product that people love and play is one of the greatest joys of my life. Working with a team is incredibly rewarding and interacting with the game's community is loads of fun. I was also given the opportunity to coordinate community events and host livestreams unveiling
new releases and discussing our roadmap. Designing and implementing changes and watching the community's reaction is priceless.

I love learning new things and working on all sorts of projects. I would love nothing more than to work on games for the rest of my life.

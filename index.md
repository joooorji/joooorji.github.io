I fell in love with technology at a young age. After my friend introduced me to PC games, I decided that I was going
to build my own computer. In middle school, I was finally able to achieve that goal. Since then, I have only delved
deeper into computer technology. I studied Computer Information Systems at the University of Houston, graduating in December 2022.


I first started my journey in game design with a little known game known as Dragon Nest. I first played Dragon Nest in 2011.
I was enchanted by the game, playing it almost every day for several years. As the game grew into the later years of its lifespan,
I as well as many other players realized how the quality of the game has decayed. From then, I had vivid imaginations of how
I would fix the game if I were given the opportunity to.

During my sophomore year of college, I joined a small team of developers for a third-party server for the game. There, I was
finally able to realize my dream of becoming a game designer and developer. Using and mastering internal tools, I was able to
design and create gameplay loops and systems for players to experience and enjoy. Creating a product that people love and play
is one of the greatest joys of my life. Working with a team is incredibly enjoyable and rewarding and interacting with the
game's community is loads of fun. I was also given the opportunity to coordinate community events and host livestreams unveiling
new releases and discussing our roadmap. Designing and implementing changes and watching the community's reaction is priceless
and I would love nothing more than to do this for the rest of my life.
